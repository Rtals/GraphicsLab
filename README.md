# GraphicsLab

**A 3D software renderer implemented from scratch in C++, without OpenGL or DirectX.**

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project implements a 3D rendering pipeline using **pure C++**, without relying on hardware-accelerated graphics APIs like OpenGL or DirectX. 

The primary goal is to deeply understand the **mathematical principles (Linear Algebra)** and **core algorithms** behind computer graphics by building the engine from the ground up.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: C++
- **Library**: SDL2 (Used strictly for window creation and pixel buffer presentation)
- **Environment**: Visual Studio 2026 (x64)
- **Architecture**: CPU-based Software Rendering

## 🚀 Features & Roadmap
- [x] SDL2 Setup
- [x] Pixel Plotting
- [x] Line Drawing
- [x] Triangle Rasterization
- [x] 3D Math Library Implementation
- [ ] 3D Cube Rotation & Transformation
- [ ] Camera System & Viewport Clipping
- [ ] Lighting & Shading
